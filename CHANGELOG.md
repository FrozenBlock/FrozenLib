Please clear changelog after each release.
Put the changelog BELOW the dashes. ANYTHING ABOVE IS IGNORED.
-----------------
- Added pushable Block Entities!
  - Blocks within the `frozenlib:has_pushable_block_entity` block tag that have a Block Entity will now be pushable.
  - The models of Block Entities will render whilst being pushed.
  - Please note this feature cannot be considered stable, so do not expect to be able to add just any Block to the tag without possible side-effects.
