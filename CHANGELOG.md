Hello
Put changelog in plain text please
Make sure to clear this after each release

Put changelog here:

-----------------
- Added `StructureMusicApi,` allowing modders to define custom music to play within structures.
- Removed `PanoramaApi` as it has potentially unsafe implementation on 1.21.5.
- Fixed spam-logging of structure names upon world load.
